The structure of this repository is as follows:

    explore.py: Loads the datasets (using xarray), processes them to compute statistics, and generates graphs (using matplotlib).
    This script uses functions and paths defined in utils_explore.py.

    utils_explore.py: Defines the multi_map function, which is used to plot the figures in explore.py.

    example_graphs/: Contains the figures generated by explore.py.

For further details on the figures, as well as an initial analysis of the results, please refer to the following document:
